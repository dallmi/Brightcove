## 1. Stable Reach, But a Platform Shift Is Underway

Year-over-year (2024 to 2025), total views held steady at ~2.1M (+10.4%), but deeper quality signals are trending down:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Views | ~2.1M | ~2.1M | +10.4% |
| Watch Hours | 164K | 118K | Declining |
| Engagement Score | 89.3% | 85.4% | -3.9 pp |
| Completion Rate | 1.6% | 1.3% | -0.3 pp |
| Play Rate | 4.0% | 5.3% | +1.3 pp |

**The SharePoint factor:** A significant driver behind the Intranet channel decline is not content quality but a **platform migration**. The majority of Intranet videos are now hosted on SharePoint, the organization's new intranet solution. Brightcove increasingly captures only a subset of actual internal video consumption.

This has two implications:

1. **The Intranet viewership decline is a migration effect, not a disengagement trend.** Employees are still watching video, just on a different platform.
2. **Brightcove's role is shifting.** As Intranet content moves to SharePoint, Brightcove's value proposition centers on external and specialized channels (Internet, research, GWM) where its analytics, player customization, and CDN capabilities remain essential.

**Key takeaway:** The declining watch hours are not an alarm signal. They reflect a deliberate infrastructure decision. The real question is: what is Brightcove's strategic role going forward? The data shows it remains essential for external-facing and specialized content where SharePoint isn't an option.

## 2. The First 25% Is Make-or-Break

The engagement funnel reveals where viewers are lost:

| Milestone | Viewers Remaining | Drop-off |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Started (1%) | 90.9% | -- |
| Reached 25% | 67.5% | **-23.4 pp** |
| Reached 50% | 40.6% | -26.9 pp |
| Reached 75% | 34.5% | -6.1 pp |
| Completed (100%) | 25.8% | -8.7 pp |

The **biggest single drop-off is in the first quarter** of every video. Nearly 1 in 4 viewers leave before reaching the 25% mark. After 50%, retention stabilizes significantly -- those who make it halfway tend to stay.

**Key takeaway:** The opening 15-30 seconds of every video is critical. Investing in stronger hooks and front-loading key messages could recover a significant portion of that 23-point drop. This is the single biggest lever for improving engagement across the entire video library.

## 3. Shorter Is Better -- But Production Doesn't Reflect This

The duration sweet spot analysis shows **1-3 minute videos** deliver the best real-world engagement (excluding autoplay-inflated sub-1-minute clips on the Internet channel). Yet production volume tells a different story:

| Duration | Videos | Performance |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0-1 min | 1,688 | Inflated by autoplay (Internet) |
| **1-3 min** | **8,793** | **Best real engagement** |
| 3-5 min | 5,111 | Good |
| 5-10 min | 4,100 | Moderate |
| 10-30 min | 7,296 | Past the engagement cliff |
| 30+ min | 900 | Low completion |

Over **7,200 videos** are in the 10-30 minute range -- far past the point where viewers disengage. There is a clear production mismatch between what works and what gets produced.

**Key takeaway:** The data argues for shifting production toward shorter, focused content pieces (1-5 minutes) rather than long-form recordings. For content that must be longer, consider breaking it into a series of shorter segments.

## 4. Mobile Has Crossed the 30% Threshold

| Device | Share |
|--------|-------|
| Desktop | 68.4% |
| **Mobile** | **30.3%** |
| Tablet | 1.1% |

Mobile viewing grew from 27.4% to 30.4% (+1.8 pp) and continues trending upward. Several channels already see significantly higher mobile usage -- circleone at **42.8%** mobile traffic.

**Key takeaway:** With nearly 1 in 3 views now on mobile, a mobile-first content strategy is no longer optional. This means: larger text overlays, subtitles enabled by default, consideration of vertical or square formats, and testing all content on mobile devices before publishing.

## 5. A Massive Stale Content Problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Videos not viewed in 180+ days | **18,414** (66% of library) |
| Hours of stale content | 4,024 hours |
| Lifetime views of stale videos | 1.8M (once valuable) |
| Videos 2+ years old | 12,281 (48%) |
| Videos under 3 months old | 1,537 (<6%) |

Two-thirds of the entire video library is effectively dead weight. These videos clutter search results, consume storage, and potentially surface outdated or incorrect information to employees.

Engagement shows a slight decline with content age (57.8% to 52.2%), but the bigger issue is discoverability -- stale content makes it harder for employees to find current, relevant videos.

**Key takeaway:** A content lifecycle policy (archive, retire, or refresh) could dramatically improve content discoverability, reduce storage costs, and ensure employees find current information. Compliance and evergreen content should be exempt; everything else should have a review date.

## 6. Channel Strategy: The Portfolio View

Using a BCG-style matrix (reach vs. engagement), the 11 channels fall into clear strategic segments:

| Quadrant | Channels | Recommended Action |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| **Stars** | Internet, research, Intranet, fa_web | Invest and grow |
| **Opportunities** | research_internal, impact | Increase promotion -- high engagement but low reach |
| **Cash Cows** | circleone, neo | Maintain current investment |
| **Reconsider** | SuMiTrust, digital_networks_events, MyWay | Evaluate ROI and purpose |

**Important caveats:**

- **Internet** accounts for 78% of all views but is heavily inflated by autoplay/loop behavior. Engagement metrics above 100% on this channel reflect replay counting, not genuine re-watches.
- **Intranet** is classified as a Star based on historical data, but its volume is actively declining due to the SharePoint migration. In future quarters, it may naturally shift quadrants -- not because content failed, but because the platform moved.
- **research_internal and impact** show the biggest untapped potential: high engagement with small audiences suggests the content resonates but isn't reaching enough people.

The cross-channel analysis reveals significant gaps:

| Metric | Highest | Lowest | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Engagement | Internet 109.6% | MyWay 32.5% | 77.1 pp |
| Play Rate | circleone 66.0% | MyWay 4.3% | 61.7 pp |
| Mobile Share | circleone 42.8% | -- | -- |

**Key takeaway:** The "Reconsider" channels (SuMiTrust, digital_networks_events, MyWay) need a clear assessment: is low performance due to niche audience (acceptable) or poor content/distribution (fixable)? The "Opportunity" channels deserve more promotion investment.

## 7. Regional and Temporal Patterns

### Geography
| Region | Views |
|--------|-------|
| Switzerland (CH) | 2.3M |
| United Kingdom (UK) | 708K |
| United States (US) | 520K |
| 12 other countries | Remaining |

Note: UK shows inflated engagement (284.4% avg) due to Internet channel autoplay effects.

### Day of Week
- **Peak day:** Tuesday
- **Weekday viewing:** 86.1%
- **Weekend viewing:** 13.9%

### Seasonality
- **Peak month:** January
- **Lowest month:** December
- Classic corporate calendar pattern: engagement dips during holiday periods and peaks at the start of the year

**Key takeaway:** Content publishing should be optimized for Tuesday-Wednesday mornings. Avoid December launches for high-impact content. January is the prime window for maximum visibility.

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Fix the First 25% (Highest Impact)
Implement opening-hook guidelines for all video producers. The 23-point early drop-off is the single biggest lever for improving engagement. Concrete actions:
- Mandate a compelling hook in the first 10 seconds
- Front-load the key message before the 25% mark
- Use chapter markers for longer content so viewers can skip to relevant sections

### 2. Launch a Content Lifecycle Policy (Quick Win)
With 18,414 stale videos and 48% of content over 2 years old, an archival program would:
- Improve search relevance and content discoverability
- Reduce storage and licensing costs
- Ensure employees find current, accurate information
- Exempt compliance, regulatory, and evergreen content from retirement

### 3. Shift to Mobile-First, Short-Form Production (Strategic)
The data clearly shows 1-3 minute videos outperform, and mobile now exceeds 30% of viewing. Updated production guidelines should:
- Target 1-5 minutes as the default duration
- Break longer content into a series of short segments
- Require mobile-friendly formatting (subtitles, larger text, square/vertical options)
- Test all content on mobile before publishing

### 4. Clarify Brightcove's Strategic Role (Platform Decision)
With Intranet migrating to SharePoint, define where Brightcove adds unique value:
- **Keep on Brightcove:** External-facing content (Internet), specialized channels (research, fa_web, GWM), anything requiring advanced analytics, player customization, or CDN delivery
- **Migrate to SharePoint:** Internal communications that don't need Brightcove's capabilities
- **Evaluate:** Channels in the "Reconsider" quadrant for potential consolidation

### 5. Invest in Opportunity Channels
research_internal and impact show high engagement with small audiences. Increasing their visibility through better promotion, cross-channel linking, or featured placement could unlock significant value at low cost.

## Data Quality Notes

- **Internet channel engagement** is inflated by autoplay/loop behavior (hero banners, embedded players that auto-replay). Engagement scores above 100% on this channel reflect Brightcove counting replays and rewinds, not genuine viewer behavior.
- **Intranet channel** provides the most reliable engagement data -- employees actively click to play, with no autoplay artifacts.
- **video_duration** is sourced from Brightcove CMS API in milliseconds.
- **Engagement milestones** (video_engagement_1/25/50/75/100) are raw view counts, converted to percentages by dividing by total views.
- **2026 data** is partial (January only) and excluded from year-over-year comparisons.
