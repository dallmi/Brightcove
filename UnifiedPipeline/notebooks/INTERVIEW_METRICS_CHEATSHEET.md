## Quick Metric Calculator

Use these formulas with YOUR data:

### Completion Rate Improvement
```
Improvement % = ((New Rate - Old Rate) / Old Rate) × 100
Example: (76 - 31) / 31 × 100 = 145% improvement
```

### Mobile Growth
```
Growth = New % - Old %
% Change = ((New - Old) / Old) × 100
Example: (31% - 18%) = +13 points, or +72% growth
```

### Cost Savings (Platform Consolidation)
```
If you consolidated X channels:
Estimated savings = X channels × $5,000/year per channel
Example: 2 channels × $5,000 = $10,000 saved
```

### Cost Savings (Storage)
```
If you archived X TB:
Estimated savings = X TB × $20/TB/year
Example: 2.3 TB × $20 = $46/year
```

### Training ROI
```
If completion improved by X percentage points:
Hours saved = (X / 100) × Num_employees × Avg_training_hours × Hourly_cost
Example: (45 / 100) × 1000 employees × 2 hours × $100 = $90,000
```

## Metric Quality Checklist

Use this to evaluate which metrics to emphasize:

| Criteria | Good ✅ | Bad ❌ |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Specificity** | "Reduced costs by $47K" | "Saved money" |
| **Attribution** | "My analysis showed..." | "We noticed..." |
| **Actionability** | "Led to decision to..." | "We found that..." |
| **Outcome** | "Resulting in X% improvement" | "We made changes" |
| **Scale** | "Across 11 channels" | "For some channels" |

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **"I think" or "approximately"**
✅ Use specific numbers from your data

❌ **Technical jargon** ("DuckDB", "Python", "API")
✅ Business impact ("analytics infrastructure", "data consolidation")

❌ **Vague outcomes** ("improved performance")
✅ Quantified results ("increased completion by 45%")

❌ **Your work in isolation** ("I built...")
✅ Business impact ("This enabled leadership to...")

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch Template

Fill in with YOUR numbers:

> "I built a video analytics platform that consolidated data from **[X]** channels covering **[Y]** videos. My analysis revealed that **[key insight with number]**, which led to **[business decision]**. The result was **[quantifiable outcome]**, delivering **[ROI metric]** in value to the organization."

## Final Tips

1. **Lead with impact, follow with scale**
   - "Increased completion by 45%" (impact)
   - "...across 5,000 training videos" (scale)

2. **Use the "Rule of 3"**
   - Pick 3 best metrics
   - Use 3 examples in each STAR response
   - Practice 3 different STAR stories

3. **Connect to business value**
   - Every metric should answer "So what?"
   - Link to cost, risk, efficiency, or growth

4. **Be ready to go deeper**
   - Interviewer: "How did you calculate that?"
   - You: Have the methodology ready (not the SQL!)
